Drupal VM can be used to bake and share [Docker](https://www.docker.com) images.

While building a single Docker container with the entire LAMP/LEMP/LAPP stack is not necessarily the best way to manage Docker-based infrastructure, it works.

TODO:

  - composer docker-bake
  - composer docker-save-image
  - composer docker-load-image
