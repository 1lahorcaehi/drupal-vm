In this article, we will show you how to hack Wow 4.3.4 Damagel and boost your DPS by modifying some of its settings and files. This hack will allow you to increase your damage multiplier, bypass the addon's security checks, and avoid detection by Blizzard's anti-cheat system. However, we must warn you that this hack is illegal and may result in your account being banned or suspended. Use it at your own risk.
 
## Step 1: Download and Install Wow 4.3.4 Damagel
 
The first step is to download and install Wow 4.3.4 Damagel from its official website or from a trusted source. You can find the latest version of the addon here: [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/damagel](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/damagel). After downloading the zip file, extract it to your World of Warcraft folder, usually located at C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\\_retail\_\Interface\AddOns.
 
## Step 2: Modify the Settings File
 
The next step is to modify the settings file of Wow 4.3.4 Damagel, which is located at C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\\_retail\_\WTF\Account\<your account="" name="">\SavedVariables\Damagel.lua. Open this file with a text editor such as Notepad or Notepad++. You will see a lot of lines of code that look like this:</your>

    DamagelDB = ["profileKeys"] = 	[" - "] = "Default",,["profiles"] = 	["Default"] = 		["damageMultiplier"] = 1,		["securityCheck"] = true,		["detectionAlert"] = true,	,,

To hack Wow 4.3.4 Damagel, you need to change some of these values. First, change the damageMultiplier value from 1 to any number you want, such as 10 or 100. This will increase your damage output by that factor. For example, if you normally deal 1000 damage per hit, changing the damageMultiplier to 10 will make you deal 10000 damage per hit.
 
Next, change the securityCheck value from true to false. This will disable the addon's security checks that prevent you from using the hack on official servers. Normally, the addon will detect if you are playing on a live server or a private server and adjust its settings accordingly. If you are playing on a live server, the addon will limit your damageMultiplier to 1 and enable its detectionAlert feature, which will warn you if Blizzard's anti-cheat system detects your hack. If you are playing on a private server, the addon will allow you to use any damageMultiplier value and disable its detectionAlert feature.
 
By changing the securityCheck value to false, you are tricking the addon into thinking that you are always playing on a private server and bypassing its limitations. However, this also means that you are exposing yourself to Blizzard's anti-cheat system and risking your account's safety.
 
Finally, change the detectionAlert value from true to false. This will disable the addon's detectionAlert feature, which will warn you if Blizzard's anti-cheat system detects your hack. Normally, the addon will display a message on your screen and play a sound if it detects that your hack is being detected by Blizzard's anti-cheat system. This is meant to alert you and give you a chance to stop using the hack before you get banned or suspended.
 
By changing the detectionAlert value to false, you are silencing the addon's warnings and ignoring its alerts. However, this also means that you are increasing your chances of getting caught and punished by Blizzard's
